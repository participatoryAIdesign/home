              We invite researchers, practitioners, and professionals working at the intersection of AI, public policy, and civic engagement 
              to join our upcoming hybrid workshop on <strong>Emerging Practices in Participatory AI Design in Public Sector Innovation</strong>. 
              This workshop will explore critical themes and methods that facilitate public participation and community engagement---in the scoping, 
              design, and implementation of public sector algorithms that are more inclusive and responsive to public needs. We will explore the 
              following themes: </p>

            <h3>Evaluating Emerging Participatory Methods</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> We will assess various participatory design methods currently in use within public sector AI projects, 
                  highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in engaging communities. Participants will share insights on how these methods 
                  can be adapted or expanded to ensure more meaningful public involvement.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assessing Key Elements that Enhance Participation and Documentable Outcomes.</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> This theme focuses on identifying the essential elements that foster effective public participation in the public sector, 
                  as well as exploring documentable and/or measurable outcomes that can demonstrate the success of engagement efforts. We will discuss 
                  strategies for building trust, ensuring transparency, and capturing diverse perspectives necessary for equitable AI systems.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>Embedding Participation Requirements in AI Procurement Contracts.</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> As many cities acquire AI from private vendors, this theme will explore how public agencies can include participation 
                  requirements in procurement contracts. We will discuss how embedding these requirements can ensure accountability and alignment with public 
                  interests.

              We encourage submissions in the form of 3-4 page papers, which can address any of the workshopâ€™s themes or provide a motivation statement 
              explaining your interest in participatory AI design. Submissions will be reviewed by two organizers, with an emphasis on both the quality 
              of the work and ensuring a diverse, interdisciplinary group of participants. This is an opportunity to contribute to and help shape the 
              evolving landscape of AI in public innovation. For more details and submission guidelines, please visit our workshop website or reach out 
              to the organizers.
